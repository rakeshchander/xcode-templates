# xcode-templates

Templates are very useful in terms of

- setting up basic structure with minimum input
- reducing duplication of steps
- standardising structure



In this repo, I have added below Templates —

- Project Templates - App, Unit Test, UI Test
- File Templates - MVVM



Download this repo, and follow below steps -

- Downlad respective template (.xctemplate)
- Go to finder location - ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/
- Create a new folder named “Templates” – if doesn’t exist
- Create a new folder named “Custom” – if doesn’t exist
- Copy Paste contents of all respective Templates folder from this repo to Custom folder



Now, when you do "New Project" or "New File", you will be able to see these templates and use them.
